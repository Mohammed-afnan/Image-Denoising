The GAN was found to be the most popular approach for CNN picture denoising. For extraction, several approaches employed the generator and discriminator. production of a clean image Surprisingly, some researchers believe that the GAN approach was integrated with the DCNN algorithms. The CNN and U-Net were also used as feedforward sources. The leftovers researchers utilised the network on various occasions. a justification
The residual network's effectiveness and efficiency may explain its widespread use. The residual network was utilised by the researchers to restrict the number of convolutions in their network.
So, with the help of this de-noising algorithm, there are many applications such as tracking, video processing, image analysis. We can also use this image de-noising in night vision images because in low light vision the images captured by the cctv cameras are very noisy so we can easily remove noise from those images as well.
